## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to evaluate and fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it privately via email to security@sourcegraph.com. We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue promptly.
